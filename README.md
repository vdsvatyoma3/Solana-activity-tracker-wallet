## Telegram Notification Setup

To receive notifications in Telegram, insert your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) into the 'telegram-settings.txt' file, located in the program directory.

## Getting Started: Installation

Download a pre-built build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself.

## Building the Project: Step-by-Step Instructions

The project is written in C++ and requires several dependencies. We recommend using **vcpkg** to handle these dependencies:

### Installing Dependencies with vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t already have it, clone the repository and install **vcpkg** by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system's PATH environment variable.
3.  Run the following commands to install the dependencies:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install openssl
    ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install nlohmann-json
    ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install cryptopp
    ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install libsodium
    ```

4.  After installing the dependencies, build the project.

### Building with Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure that **vcpkg** is correctly integrated. Follow the instructions for [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio).
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Make sure that all dependencies are correctly installed via **vcpkg** and are accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile the project using the following command (adjust as necessary):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line Interface

Here's how to use the program from the command line:

1.  **-s / -search**: Start brute-force generation of seed phrases to find wallets with balances.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Start tracking a specific address. The program will monitor activity.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate the specified number of Solana wallets. Replace `<NUMBER>` with the number you desire.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: View wallet info using the provided seed phrase. Replace `<MNEMONIC>` with the seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Show the balance of a given address on the Solana network.

## Important Notes

-   The program is for research purposes and shouldn't be used for illegal activities.
-   Cryptocurrency investments involve risks. Always ensure the security of your data and wallets.
